  Some think it’s not prudent to run tests or replicate bugs using production databases. Cowards! 
  But as sometimes they’re bound to be the decision-makers, we need to learn how to populate a local DB with mock data. In the process, you will learn good engineering practices, which will come in handy throughout your career.
summary: |
  Great success! Now we have a working system and data to play with and run tests on to see how real users experience the system.
  
  And that’s not all. From now on, every time a new user needs to use the system locally or in a brand new environment, they’ll have a seed script ready to populate the DB in seconds. Hope you’re proud because we definitely are!
